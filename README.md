# Multithread Particles Simulation
This repository simulates particles' behaviour specified [here](https://github.com/mahsaghn/Multithread_Particles_Simulation/blob/main/problem_specification.pdf). It is possible to simulate particles in whether sequential or parallel mode.  

To run the simulation follow the below commands:

- **Sequential**: 

  ``bash run_seq.sh {N} {Number_of_Particles}``
  
- **Parallel**: 

  In this repository, OpenMP interface for the purpose of multithreading.
  
  ``bash run.sh {N} {Number_of_Particles}``
 
  
For more details see the [documentation](https://github.com/mahsaghn/Multithread_Particles_Simulation/blob/main/document.pdf) of the code.
